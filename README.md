## How It Works

If the mod is **enabled** and running without any issues:

- **Page 0:** The original **Taxman Shop** screen.
- **Changing Pages:** You can either press the **Left/Right Arrow** keys on your keyboard, or touch the arrows directly on the screen.

#
- **Item Listing:** You'll now see all the items you own, displayed with icons.
  Each page shows up to **11 items**, with values shown as `X / Y` next to each.
- **What does X / Y mean?**
  - **X** → The current amount of that item you own.
  - **Y** → The maximum amount you can own.
  - If the limit is reached, it will display **`MAX`**.
- **What if I try to buy more than the limit?**
  Don’t worry — you can’t. Once you reach the maximum amount, the game won’t spawn that item again in the shop until you use one.
- **New Items:** A newly purchased item will show **`NEW`** or **`+n NEW`** next to its name.

#
- **Battery Indicators:**
  You’ll see a row of **I** symbols in front of certain items.
  - 🟡 **Yellow I** → Remaining battery bars.
  - ⚫ **Black I** → Used battery bars.

## Multiplayer Behavior

This mod is **client-based**, but multiplayer-friendly.

- If the **lobby host** has this mod installed, everyone (who has this mod installed) can see all their owned items correctly — just like in singleplayer.
- If the **host doesn’t have the mod**, other players won’t see newly purchased items until the next shop, and battery levels might appear incorrectly.

## Compatibility

This mod does **not modify any original game files**.
It only **temporarily overrides** the `emojis.material` with `emojisplus.material` inside
`Canvas/Mask/Text (TMP)` — and **only while in the Shop** —
to display the new item emojis.
